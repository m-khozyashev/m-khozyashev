## Hi I'm Maksim <img src="resources/icons/waving_hand.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">
I'm Maksim Khozyashev an iOS Software Engineer with 8+ years of commercial experience. 

Worked both remotely and onsite in teams of 3 to 500+ people. I can get brief task descriptions from the business and manage a full development cycle: from creating tickets in a task tracker to release to the production with CI/CD and analytics. 

Expert in functional reactive programming and declarative style of UI implementation. In addition to standard iOS applications, I have deep experience with background app execution, geolocation, and motion sensors. 

It is essential to me to make business value, cause I dedicate myself to work and can‚Äôt imagine another way of life.

    ‚ù§Ô∏èMy work values
</summary>

<br>

- I'm looking forward to a match in work values! For me, work values are about how decisions are made: how people are hired, how they are dismissed, etc. It‚Äôs crucial that all these processes are transparent, systematic and non-toxic.
- I resonate with companies that consider how to reduce the risk of employee burnout.
- I desire a company that understands its mission and acts accordingly.
- It would be fantastic if the company embraced a mix of flat and hierarchical decision-making structures (no absolute power concentrated in the hands of a few from the management) but also not fully distributed democracy either.

#### Objective: 
The company faced the challenge of high regression bug frequency, UI inconsistency between different modules and a complex onboarding process for new developers.

#### My Role: 
As an on-call engineer and code owner of three critical app modules, I led quality assurance initiatives, collaborated across teams for UI uniformity, and enhanced onboarding procedures.

#### What I Did:
- Increased unit test number from 863 to 951, nearly eliminating regression bugs (0 average) and raising the crash-free rate from 93% to 99.7%.
- On-call engineer responsible for quick reaction (less than 4 hours) to critical bugs
- Collaborated with other teams to make UI elements consistent across the entire app since I was tired of inconsistency
- Code owner of 3 app modules (core feature, user profile, user settings)
- Improved onboarding process to simplify new members adaptation

#### Results: 
Achieved a near-zero average in regression bugs and elevated the crash-free rate to 99.7%. The cross-team collaboration led to a unified app design, and onboarding improvements halved the new member adaptation period from 1 month to 2 weeks.

#### Objective: 
The app's onboarding process was inefficient, the localization process took a long time for developers, and the UI inconsistent

#### My Role: 
My focus was on elevating the visual interface, automating key development processes, and ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience.

#### What I Did:
- Created new onboarding screens for the app with SwiftUI and Metal frameworks.
- Automated localization process with a script in Swift.
- Collaborated with designers to refine screens, ensuring pixel-perfect UI and frame-perfect animations

#### Results: 
Redesigned onboarding screens increased short-term user retention by 30%. Localization automation sped up processes by 10x freeing up valuable developer resources. Collaboration with designers ensured UI/UX precision, enhancing user satisfaction.

- Developed and supervised the process of code migration from Objective-C to Swift using automation tools and unit tests, making it fast and bug-free
- Interacted with the Apple Review team to unban the app in the App Store, found out the problem, and made all necessary changes in less than a week
- Led a team of 3 iOS developers

#### Results: 
Efficiently resolved geolocation issues and app ban within a month, enhancing app functionality and compliance. Streamlined code migration and mentored a team, boosting development speed and performance.

#### Objective: 
The company's application had heavy Objective-C legacy, and was hard to maintain and develop. It was necessary to migrate the code base to Swift to make it more friendly for new developers. Also, the code base needed refactoring to improve the feature development speed and reduce the bugs amount.

#### My Role: 
My responsibilities included code base refactoring and migration, developing new features, and reducing bugs.

#### What I Did:
- Refactored the app‚Äôs single storyboard containing approximately 150 ViewControllers into 25 separate storyboards, and implemented router entities instead of segue usage.
- Participated in migration of existing code base from Objective-C to Swift.
- Was working on adding new features to the app.

#### Results: 
Storyboard refactoring significantly decreased storyboard loading time(up to 95%), simplified adding changes in routing and made code more clear and readable.¬†Successfully migrated more than 200 files to Swift manually and using automation tools.¬†Added several important business features including task assignment for employees and time tracking which expanded the app‚Äôs user base.
